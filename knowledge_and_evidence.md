### Fundamental code comprehension

 Answer each of the following questions **as they relate to that code** supplied by in this repository (ignore `sense_hat.py`):

1. Examine the code for the `smiley.py` file and provide  an example of a variable of each of the following types and their corresponding values (`_` should be replaced with the appropriate values):

   | Type                    | name  | value                  |
   | ----------              |-------|------------------------|
   | built-in primitive type | Bool  | dimmed=True            |
   | built-in composite type | List  | self.pixels = []       |
   | user-defined type       | Tuple | Yellow = (255, 255 ,0) |

2. Fill in (`_`) the following table based on the code in `smiley.py`:

   | Object                   | Type   |
   | ------------             |--------|
   | self.pixels              | List   |
   | A member of self.pixels  | Tuple  |
   | self                     | Object |

3. Examine the code for `smiley.py`, `sad.py`, and `happy.py`. Give an example of each of the following control structures using an example from **each** of these files. Include the first line and the line range:

   | Control Flow | File      | First line          | Line range |
   | ------------ |-----------|---------------------|------------|
   |  sequence    | smiley.py | Y = self.YELLOW     | 15 - 26    |
   |  selection   | sad.py    | if wide_open:       | 26 - 29    |
   |  iteration   | happy.py  | for pixel in mouth: | 21 - 22    |

4. Though everything in Python is an object, it is sometimes said to have four "primitive" types. Examining the three files `smiley.py`, `sad.py`, and `happy.py`, identify which of the following types are used in any of these files, and give an example of each (use an example from the code, if applicable, otherwise provide an example of your own):

   | Type                    | Used?      | Example                         |
   | ----------------------- |------------|---------------------------------|
   | int                     | smiley.py  | 255                             |
   | float                   | happy.py   | Line 33: delay=0.25             |
   | str                     | my example | welcome_message = 'I am happy.' |
   | bool                    | sad.py     | Line 19: wide_open=True         |

5. Examining `smiley.py`, provide an example of a class variable and an instance variable (attribute). Explain **why** one is defined as a class variable and the other as an instance variable.

> class variable: WHITE = (255, 255, 255)    instance variable: line 22 in happy.py (self.pixels[pixel] = self.BLANK)
>>A Class variable is the variable assigned in a global scope and can be called by any subclass of the superclass.
> An Instance variable can only be called upon in a local scope and used within that method when called.

6. Examine `happy.py`, and identify the constructor (initializer) for the `Happy` class:
   1. What is the purpose of a constructor (in general) and this one (in particular)?

   > self.draw_mouth() and self.draw_eyes(). These contructors stantiate the object for use but don't return a value. For example,
   > self.draw_mouth() doesn't return a value, but gives form to the method def draw_mouth(self) where then a value can
   > be returned.
   >

   2. What statement(s) does it execute (consider the `super` call), and what is the result?

   > the statement executed is self.pixels from the parent Class smiley. The super call allows the child or instance class
   > call upon the parent or base class as a proxy, similar to using smiley().__init__() (dunder init)
   >

### Code style

1. What code style is used in the code? Is it likely to be the same as the code style used in the SenseHat? Give to reasons as to why/why not:
   
> uses the PEP-8 styleguide. Likely uses the same code style used in the SenseHat as this is the common styleguide for
> Python 
>

2. List three aspects of this convention you see applied in the code.

> 1. Four-space indentation.
> 2. Function naming conventions begin with a verb e.g. draw_eyes, dim_display.
> 3. Class names use the CapitalWords convention, where the first letter in separate words is a capital.
> 
>

3. Give two examples of organizational documentation in the code.

> 1. Single line comments such as in smiley.py e.g. # We have encapsulated the SenseHat object
> 2. Block comments such as in smiley.py e.g.         """
        Set the SenseHat's light intensity to low (True) or high (False)
        :param dimmed: Dim the display if True, otherwise don't dim
        """
>

### Identifying and understanding classes

> Note: Ignore the `sense_hat.py` file when answering the questions below

1. List all the classes you identified in the project. Indicate which classes are base classes and which are subclasses. For subclasses, identify all direct base classes.
  
  Use the following table for your answers:

| Class Name | Super or Sub? | Direct parent(s)  |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Happy      | Sub           | Smiley, Blinkable |
| Smiley     | Super         | -                 |
| Sad        | Sub           | Smiley            |
2. Explain the concept of abstraction, giving an example from the project (note "implementing an ABC" is **not** in itself an example of abstraction). (Max 150 words)

> Abstraction is the concept of hiding complexity of the program from the user and instead presenting them a more
> simple interface. Example, simply calling Happy() and smiley.show() in main.py where it returns a happy face, but behind the scenes is multiple
> attributes, attributes and superclass calls which make up what is displayed.
>

3. What is the name of the process of deriving from base classes? What is its purpose in this project? (Max 150 words)

> Deriving from base classes is Inheritance. The purpose of inheritance in this project can be, the Smiley super class
> being the base or literal head of the program, and the subclasses or child classes Sad and Happy inherit attributes
> from the Smiley superclass.
>

### Compare and contrast classes

Compare and contrast the classes Happy and Sad.

1. What is the key difference between the two classes?
   > The Sad subclass inherits from one super class, being Smiley. Whereas, the Happy subclass inherits from a super
   > class and an abstract class.
   >
2. What are the key similarities?
   > Both Happy and Sad subclasses inherit from the same superclass - Smiley.
   >
3. What difference stands out the most to you and why?
   > The Happy subclass inherits from an abstract class and an abstract method(blink). The Sad subclass should also be
   > able to inherit from the same abstract method because it also has the same attributes(draw_eyes), but has not been
   > chosen to as it also does not have the correct method blink().
   >
4. How does this difference affect the functionality of these classes
   > The class Sad doesn't inherit from the Blinkable abstract class, doesn't have a blink() method, and therefor cannot
   > use the blink abstract method.
   >

### Where is the Sense(Hat) in the code?

1. Which class(es) utilize the functionality of the SenseHat?
   > Smiley utilizes the SenseHat functionality as well as the Happy subclass when calling .show() in the blink method.
   >
2. Which of these classes directly interact with the SenseHat functionalities?
   > The Smiley class.
   >
3. Discuss the hiding of the SenseHAT in terms of encapsulation (100-200 Words)
   > Hiding SenseHat helps with understanding what the program is doing by using abstraction to hide complex code.
   >

### Sad Smileys Can’t Blink (Or Can They?)

Unlike the `Happy` smiley, the current implementation of the `Sad` smiley does not possess the ability to blink. Let's first explore how blinking has been implemented in the Happy Smiley by examining the blink() method, which takes one argument that determines the duration of the blink.

**Understanding Blink Mechanism:**

1. Does the code's author believe that every `Smiley` should be able to blink? Explain.

> No, because there is no Blink method inside the Sad class.
>

2. For those smileys that blink, does the author expect them to blink in the same way? Explain.

> No, if there was a specific way the author wanted all smileys to blink, it would be a method to be called from the
> Blinkable class, however the Blink method is only specific to the Happy class.
>

3. Referring to the implementation of blink in the Happy and Sad Smiley classes, give a brief explanation of what polymorphism is.

> Polymorphism is the act of using an object in different scenarios and getting different results based on the circumstance.
> Using the Happy class as an example, when the blink method is called, it uses the .show() method from the Smiley superclass
> which usually hides or shows the entire smiley, but in this case it hides or shows only the values relating to eyes.
>

4. How is inheritance used in the blink method, and why is it important for polymorphism?

> Similarly to the previous question, the .show() method from the Smiley superclass is inherited to the Happy subclass.
> Where this method would usually show or hide the entire smiley, because of polymorphism this can be manipulated to
> only show or hide the eyes of the smiley.
>
1. **Implement Blink in Sad Class:**

   - Create a new method called `blink` within the Sad class. Ensure you use the same method signature as in the Happy class:

   ```python
   def blink(self, delay=0.25):
       pass  # Replace 'pass' with your implementation
   ```

2. **Code Implementation:** Implement the code that allows the Sad smiley to blink. Use the implementation from the Happy Smiley as a reference. Ensure your new method functions similarly by controlling the blink duration through the `delay` argument.

3. **Testing the Implementation:**

- Test the new blink functionality on your Raspberry Pi or within the Python classes provided. You might need to adjust the `main.py` script to incorporate Sad Smiley's new blinking capability.

Include a screenshot of the sad smiley or the modified `main.py`:

![Sad Smiley Blinking](screenshots/sad_smiley_blink.png)

- Observe and document the Sad smiley as it blinks its eyes. Describe any adjustments or issues encountered during implementation.

  > I had to double check and ensure all related modules were imported correctly. For example, 'import time' to the Sad
  > superclass to ensure the smiley opens its eyes and uses the delay correctly.

  ### If It Walks Like a Duck…

  Previously, you implemented the blink functionality for the Sad smiley without utilizing the class `Blinkable`. Assuming you did not use `Blinkable` (even if you actually did), consider how the Sad smiley could blink similarly to the Happy smiley without this specific class.

  1. **Class Type Analysis:** What kind of class is `Blinkable`? Inspect its superclass for clues about its classification.

     > If I didn't use the Blinkable class, I would get the same result by calling blink(self) in Main as long as the 
      blink method is correctly formed in the Sad subclass. Blinkable is also an abstract class due to the ABC
        (Abstract Base Class) being passed as an argument.

  2. **Class Implementation:** `Blinkable` is a class intended to be implemented by other classes. What generic term describes this kind of class, which is designed for implementation by others? **Clue**: Notice the lack of any concrete implementation and the naming convention.

  > An Abstract Class is intended to be used by other classes but cannot be instantiated or rather cannot be a super class.

  3. **OO Principle Identification:** Regarding your answer to question (2), which Object-Oriented (OO) principle does this represent? Choose from the following and justify your answer in 1-2 sentences: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation.

  > Inheritance because the abstract class acts as a 'contract' where all abstract methods and attributes inherited
  > must be in the subclass, as if laying the foundation for the subclass.

  4. **Implementation Flexibility:** Explain why you could grant the Sad Smiley a blinking feature similar to the Happy Smiley's implementation, even without directly using `Blinkable`.

  > Because the method of blink() calls upon a method of draw_eyes() which the Sad class has. The blinkable abstract
  > class is only an interface and does not consist of an abstract method called blink.

  5. **Concept and Language Specificity:** In relation to your response to question (4), what is this capability known as, and why is it feasible in Python and many other dynamically typed languages but not in most statically typed programming languages like C#? **Clue** This concept is hinted at in the title of this section.

  > This capability is known as Duck Typing, if a function works then the types being passed around doesn't matter thanks
  > to the dynamically typed language of Python.

  ## Refactoring

  ### Does a Smiley Have to Be Yellow?

  While our current implementation predominantly features yellow smileys, emotional expressions like sickness or anger typically utilize colors like green, red, or orange. We'll explore the feasibility of integrating these colors into our smileys.

  1. **Defined Colors and Their Location:**

     1. Which colors are defined and in which class(s)?
        > White, Green, Red, Yellow and Blank are colors defined within the Smiley class.
     2. What type of variables hold these colors? Are the values expected to change during the program's execution? Explain your answer.
        > The variables correlate to the colors above with tuples assigned. All the variables are constants due to they're
        all upper case and are not expected to change during the program's execution.
     3. Add the color blue to the appropriate class using the appropriate format and values.

  2. **Usage of Color Variables:**

     1. In which classes are the color variables used?
        > The color variables are used in the Sad, Happy and Smiley classes.

  3. **Simple Method to Change Colors:**
  4. What is the easiest way you can think to change the smileys to green? Easiest, not necessarily the best!
     > In the Smiley class, change Y = self.YELLOW to Y = self.GREEN

  Here's a revised version of the "Flexible Colors – Step 1" section for the smiley project, incorporating your specifications for formatting and content updates:

  ### Flexible Colors – Step 1

  Changing the color of the smileys once is straightforward, but it isn't very flexible. To facilitate various colors for smileys, it is advisable not to hardcode values in any class. This approach was identified earlier as a necessary change. Let's start by removing the built-in assumptions about color in our classes.

  1. **Add a method called `complexion` to the `Smiley` class:** Implement this instance method to return `self.YELLOW`. Using the term "complexion" instead of "color" provides a more abstract terminology that focuses on the meaning rather than implementation.

  2. **Refactor subclasses to use the `complexion` method:** Modify any subclass that directly accesses the color variable to instead utilize the new `complexion` method. This ensures that color handling is centralized and can be easily modified in the future.

  3. **Determine the applicable Object-Oriented principle:** Consider whether Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, or Encapsulation best applies to the modifications made in this step.

  4. **Verify the implementation:** Ensure that the modifications function as expected. The smileys should still display in yellow, confirming that the new method correctly replaces the direct color references.

  This step is crucial for setting up a more flexible system for color management in the smiley display logic, allowing for easy adjustments and extensions in the future.

  ### Flexible Colors – Step 2

  Having removed the hardcoded color values, we now enhance the base class to support dynamic color assignments more effectively.

  1. **Modify the `__init__()` method in the `Smiley` class:** Introduce a default argument named `complexion` and assign `YELLOW` as its default value. This allows the instantiation of smileys with customizable colors.

  2. **Introduce a new instance variable:** Create a variable called `my_complexion` and assign the `complexion` parameter to it. This step ensures that each smiley instance can maintain its own color state.

  3. **Rationale for `my_complexion`:** Using a distinct instance variable like `my_complexion` avoids potential conflicts with the method parameter names and clarifies that it is an attribute specific to the object.

  4. **Bulk rename:** We want to update our grid to use the value of complexion, but we have so many `Y`'s in the grid. Use your IDE's refactoring tool to rename all instances of the **symbol** `Y` to `X`. Where `X` is the value of the `complexion` variable. Include a screenshot evidencing you have found the correct refactor tool and the changes made.

  ![Bulk Rename](screenshots/y_variable_refactoring.png)

  5. **Update the `complexion` method:** Adjust this method to return `self.my_complexion`, ensuring that whatever color is assigned during instantiation is what the smiley displays.

  6. **Verification:** Run the updated code to confirm that Smileys still defaults to yellow unless specified otherwise.

  ### Flexible Colors – Step 3

  With the foundational changes in place, it's now possible to implement varied smiley colors for different emotional expressions.

  1. **Adjust the `Sad` class initialization:** In the `Sad` class's initializer method, change the superclass call to include the `complexion` argument with the value `self.BLUE`, as shown:

     ```python
     super().__init__(complexion=self.BLUE)
     ```

  2. **Test color functionality for the Sad smiley:** Execute the program to verify that the Sad smiley now appears blue.

  3. **Ensure the Happy smiley remains yellow:** Confirm that changes to the Sad smiley do not affect the default color of the Happy smiley, which should still display in yellow.

  4. **Design and Implement An Angry Smiley:** Create an Angry smiley class that inherits from the `Smiley` class. Set the color of the Angry smiley to red by passing `self.RED` as the `complexion` argument in the superclass call.
